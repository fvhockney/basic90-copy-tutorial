# basic90-copy-tutorial

This tutorial is aimed at guiding you through learning basic HTML5 and CSS3 through the copying of a website template. Just as a painter who wishes to become a better painter will copy the work of masters, so too can aspiring web developers copy existing sites to better understand their craft.

This does not mean, however, that we should copy website design or code for our own personal use. We use it as a tool to better understand the mechanics and to grow our own style. This tutorial is to that end and that end alone. Students who go through this tutorial should use the skills they learn to create their own designs.

The website template we will be trying to recreate is located at https://www.os-templates.com/free-basic-html5-templates/basic-90

To use this tutorial, clone the repository, checkout the previous lessons tag, and follow along.
